        This sounds like a great project! Similarly to Michael's question, I'm wondering about the technologies involved in sharing the maps and other information with the pharmacists?

        Sounds like a wonderful project that it is attempting to meet a pressing health care concern for the Bangladeshi people now and in the future. My questions tend to be a bit more concrete regarding how the implementation of your project would improve the social and health conditions. I know that not all the questions can be answered at this stage of planning, but hoping you will be able to address some of them:1.	From the description, it sounds like the neighborhood pharmacists are a bit like New York City bodegas that are normally magnets for the local population. Is the main problem they are not located in the urban slums or are you targeting a population for whatever reason, do not frequent the stationary pharmacists. Is there a general distrust of the products sold at the stationary stores? Are women culturally discouraged from frequenting the stores?2.	Would this be a viable delivery method for birth control and make it more accessible? What are the cultural or social barriers? Are female clients more hesitant to deal with male pharmacists? Do husbands traditionally oppose family planning? Since poor women have been able to access public health clinics for birth control, do the mobile pharmacies afford an opportunity for lower middle-class women? Is this access possible without a health care provider issuing prescriptions?3.	Could this delivery method be used in conjunction for the improved treatment of chronic diseases with an increased and more reliable supply of drugs? I am thinking along the lines of pharmacies mail-order practice of three-month supplies of medication at a discounted price. Would that be manageable with your proposed supply chain? If the scenario is not currently possible, is it doable in a near future timeline of three to five years?4.	What about the security risks for the pharmacist drivers in Bangladesh? Distinctive trucks would be a great form of mobile marketing such as the instantly recognizable Federal Express trucks in the United States. However, does the fact that the trucks would be carrying money and drugs aboard make them a greater attraction for robberies? With the type of traffic congestion described, I could imagine an ambush of a truck en route. What kind of safeguards could be implemented?5.	Looking at the earlier comments, I see that you envision a taco truck rather than a pizza truck delivery system. Are you totally ruling out home delivery? I am thinking of infirmed, elderly or homebound clients who do not venture out at all. Any thoughts for inclusion of this population in the future?Best of luck in your endeavor,Stephanie

        This sounds like a great and innovative idea for getting pharmaceuticals into the hands of those who have difficulty accessing them, while at the same time offering a sustainable business opportunity to aspiring entrepreneurs. What would you anticipate your top 2-3 hurdles might be in rolling out this initiative? How easy do you think it would be to roll out this service to other markets?

        I am very impressed with this idea and the thoughtfulness that has clearly been demonstrated in the responses to all of the questions that have been posted. The value of this model is quite clear for populations that have limited access to pharmaceuticals right now. For people who are currently accessing "medicines" from the unregulated shops, there may be different challenges at play. What are your thoughts on competing with the unregulated shops? Is there where you would see potential subsidy models being advantageous?

        I'm very impressed by the amount of research and thought that has went into this concept. I would also like to know what kind of medicine would the truck carry? If you can grab the attention of local investors this would make a tremendous impact on this community and it would exciting to see how it will transform neighboring communities.

        Thanks, Brittany, this is a really thought-provoking idea! Two quick questions: 1. From the client perspective, the value proposition of this business is clear - much better access to high-quality medications and pharmacy services. However, I don't know much about urban Dhaka and am curious why the local pharmaceutical market hasn't already responded to capture that value. Are there any key factors preventing today's entrepreneurial pharmacists from starting up their own mobile pharmacy businesses, and if so how does this idea either address those factors or take them into account?2. Could you explain a bit more about the geospatial data, e.g. what information would be included, how you would capture it, and the ways in which that data would link back to the pharmacy franchise model?

        Super interesting way to implement push model pharmaceutical distribution. To what extent do you think market forces will contribute to the entrepreneurial pharmacists finding the neighborhoods most in need. Could this be paired with existing voucher programs for basic pharmaceuticals?

        This sounds like an impactful project with a solid business plan to address truly unmet needs in Dhaka. As someone always working to connect with local populations on public health issues (specifically air pollution in my case), I'm most immediately struck by the potential of your project to enhance/complement others by enabling public outreach opportunities to perhaps traditionally difficult to access and under-served populations. For instance, I could imagine various public health orgs finding great value in tagging along in your 'taco truck' model and giving short workshops/demos on various topics of interest to customers. Perhaps some public health orgs would be willing to invest in the base infrastructure of your program because of that potential access. In case it is of interest, I thought I'd also mention another funding opportunity, specifically for an in-country partner:-USAID's PEER program - this could provide funding to an in-country partner to work on a research-related aspect of your idea. These grants do typically have a more academic feel to them, but they do actively look to fund practical research that directly feeds into an international development solution and in practice can be quite broad in scope. Bangladesh is an eligible country: http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/peer/index.htmIt's inspiring to see a group put an awesome, impactful idea out into the world and work to make it happen.Best of luck,Christa HasenkopfCo-Founder of OpenAQ

        Finding a specific home or location in urban slums in Dhaka would seem to be challenging. As the locations of many homes/dwellings may be best know through "informal" landmarks (rather than a specific streetnumbers and address), how can you overcome this challenge to deliver to low income settings in an efficient and timely fashion?

        Dear Brittany,It seems that there is some tension between the goals of freedom of choice for the pharmacist-entrepreneur and the incorporation of geospatial data into the distribution system in order to facilitate rapid responsiveness to changing needs. Can you elaborate on what kinds of data inform what kinds of changes to the supply chain network? At what level are the decisions made about implementing the changes and how an the decision-making structure itself be changed? Also I'm curious about how to balance the need for adaptability and responsiveness and that for consistency and reliability. In a response to a previous post you mention that you expect a regular and well advertised schedule. Could you go into more detail on how clients would be able to keep abreast of changes in the routine and how they might adapt to them? Are there avenues for establishing more permanent outlets or cooperating with existing ones in the case a need is demonstrated? Finally, you mention gender as a key factor establishing trust in patient-pharmacist relationships in Bangladesh. How important are other factors such as a regular relationship vs. anonymity? Is there an interest in credentials? Thanks for your work; I hope your idea succeeds!Leon

        It is great to see a proposed sustainable solution to an increasing problem impacting a community that did virtually nothing to induce that problem! It also seems win-win in that it is addressing a problem while enabling and enhancing the socioeconomic status of the local population.To better understand the scope of the problem and proposed solution, it would be helpful to quantify the impacts and benefits if at all possible (in such complex systems, it may be difficult). Do you happen to have estimates indicating the current disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and/or predicted DALYs as climate change increases, and how this proposed solution can reduce those impacts? (Since DALYs may be hard to come by, any indication of disease incidence and reduction would be informative, including population affected and current access to medicines compared with predicated access.)Thanks for working toward business-based solutions to pressing global problems!

        This is a really great idea. One thought is how might this model not only complement the existing infrastructure of fixed-location pharmacies, but enhance it? Could this also be a pathway to get quality pharmaceuticals and better information into those drug stores? As we know, seemingly informal communities operate under incredibly nuanced and complex boundaries, both commercial and political, physical and social. Using this model to also enhance existing local pharmacies might mitigate some of the challenges associated with operating across these boundaries.

        Hi Brittany,Below is some feedback from our experts. We look forward to reading your responses!The idea itself is very impressive, as it breaks down multiple challenges. Can you please describe in a bit more detail what types of financing plans could be put in place for asset acquisition? Also, if you are to start in a pilot phase, how will you prioritize which stakeholders to engage?Have you considered including an overlay consisting of those citizens who are old and aged by living in the critical area so that you can assign a priority level? Could hospitals should also give subsidies or other incentives to those who will sign up to the program?What are some of the key barriers to access that your beneficiaries are currently facing?
